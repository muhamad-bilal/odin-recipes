 <p><br></p>
 <h3>Directions</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season with Italian seasoning.<br> Season with salt and pepper.</li><br>
    <li>Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a large,<br> non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li><br>
    <li>When oil is hot and butter is bubbling, add chicken thighs and cook until <br> browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn chicken, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until <br> juices no longer run pink, about 5 minutes more.  An instant-read thermometer <br> inserted near the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li><br>
    <li>Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a large,<br> non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li><br>
    <li>Remove chicken from the skillet, place on a serving platter, and keep warm.</li><br> 
    <li>To the same pan, over medium high heat, add remaining olive oil and butter,<br>  and allow butter to melt. Stir in onions and red pepper flakes and cook 1 to <br> 2 minutes, then add mushrooms and bell peppers. Cook an additional 2 minutes,<br>  stirring frequently.</li><br>
    <li>Add broccoli florets, zucchini, and carrots. Cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes.</li><br> 
    <li>Add asparagus, tomatoes, and garlic; cook until garlic is fragrant, about a minute.</li><br> 
    <li>Pour in chicken broth and allow to come to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer <br> and stir in peas. When broth is lightly bubbling, add cream slowly, stirring,<br>  and stir in Parmesan cheese.</li><br>
    <li>To serve place 2 chicken thighs on each plate and top with vegetables and <br> Parmesan cream. Garnish with fresh flat-leaf parsley. Serve warm.</li><br>
